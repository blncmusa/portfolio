            <p>Back in 2015, I embarked on a journey to explore the world of languages and stumbled upon the fascinating realm of coding. What started as a curiosity soon turned into a passion, leading me to develop my first app: an NHL tracker that provided real-time scores and stats for hockey enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the opportunity to create software for educational platforms, tech startups, and even a well-known language learning application. My primary focus now is on building intuitive and accessible user experiences for our clients at LinguaTech.</p> <p>I find the most satisfaction in crafting solutions where seamless design meets robust functionality, ensuring that our products are both beautiful and efficient.

In my spare time, I’ve also launched an online course that teaches the basics of app development using the Merriam-Webster API, helping others to build their own dictionary apps from scratch.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring new languages, reading sci-fi novels, spending time with my family, or adventuring in the digital realms of the latest RPGs.</p>
